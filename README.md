# CS4012: Lab 2

### Interpreter and Debugger

## Milestones

- [x] Convert project to Stack project
- [x] Step through program
- [x] Inspect variable values
- [x] Inspect History of variable
- [x] Step Backwards through program
- [x] Static Analysis to detect unused variables
- [x] Bonus: Execute arbitrary statements at any stage.

The file column is the statements that have been executed, and the statement that is next to be executed.

The variables column is the current environment.

The output column is the accumulated output for the program so far.

## Setup

Build the stack project:
```bash
stack build
```

The program can be executed by passing in the path to the file as the first argument.

Run the interpreter with the input file test.input:
```bash
stack exec interpreter-exe tests/test.input
```

To test the static analysis for detecting unused variables, just use the failingtest.input file:
```bash
stack exec interpreter-exe tests/failingtest.input
```

## Commands
 * `next` : Execute the next statement
 * `back` : Step back and undo the last statement
 * `:<variablename>` : Input a variable's name to view it's history
 * `|<Statement>`: Execute a statement at the current point of the program. E.g `|Print (Const (I 10))`
